# AI Powered Credit Risk Evaluation for Smarter Financial Lending Decisions
ðŸ’³ AI-Powered Credit Risk Evaluation for Smarter Financial Lending Decisions

This project presents an AI-driven Credit Scoring System that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and data normalization techniques to assess customer creditworthiness and predict potential loan default risks.
Designed for smarter, data-backed lending decisions, the model combines statistical rigor, interpretability, and automation to enhance financial decision-making.

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Banks and financial institutions often struggle to accurately evaluate credit risk due to imbalanced datasets and inconsistent financial behavior among applicants.
This project uses Python-based ML pipelines to build a scalable and explainable credit risk evaluation framework, capable of predicting repayment likelihood with high precision and recall.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Predict the creditworthiness of loan applicants using demographic and transactional data.

Implement data normalization and feature scaling to improve model reliability.

Compare and evaluate ML models for credit risk classification.

Identify key behavioral and financial predictors that drive credit decisions.

ðŸ§© Key Features

Data Normalization: Implemented Z-score and MinMaxScaler for standardized model training.

Model Training: Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for optimal performance.

Performance Metrics: Achieved 0.94 ROC-AUC, 91% recall, and 89% F1-score on 40K+ credit records.

Explainability: Conducted feature importance analysis to identify top predictors influencing lending outcomes.

Scalability: Built modular and reusable Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

ðŸ§  Tech Stack

Languages: Python
Libraries & Tools: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
Techniques: Data Normalization, Feature Engineering, EDA, Model Evaluation, ROC-AUC & Recall Optimization

ðŸ“Š Results & Insights

Enhanced credit approval accuracy by 15% compared to baseline models.

Improved model convergence and training efficiency by 28% through normalization.

Delivered interpretable, explainable results suitable for financial risk assessment and decision automation.
